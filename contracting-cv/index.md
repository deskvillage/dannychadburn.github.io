# Let me lead your next project

#### Available from April 2019

My recent job titles include Product Owner, Head of Content and Content Strategist, but that covers just a tiny selection of roles I've successfully taken on within companies and agencies.

Whether you're developing a feature-rich digital product, undertaking a site migration that needs meticulous management, or have a sprawling website that needs an overhaul, take a look at a few of my biggest achievements.
