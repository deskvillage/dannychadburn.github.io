# Hi, I'm Danny

Worked for big companies, startups, charities, government organisations, etc

The reason I freelance is because I love to travel. Seeing the world is an education that helps me deliver better work. Live just outside of Brighton, but blah, blah, blah..

## A few interesting facts

80% of the following facts are true - [get in touch](/contact) if you want to find out which is the little white lie.

- My second cousin is snooker legend Stephen Hendry
- I got stuck in a lift with Rowan Atkinson for 25 minutes at BBC Television Centre
- I've completed two marathons, with a PB of 3 hours 43 minutes
- I appeared as an extra in Oscar-winning movie _Gladiator_
- I suffered a heart attack at the age of 23 (bout have since made a full revovery)

## Why Tidy Swan?

When I took the freelance leap, I opted for a trading name after growing tired of phonetically spelling my own surname for the past few decades.

I mashed together a list of two-syllable adjectives with various words that rhyme with .com, then ran them through a domain name checker.

tidyswan.com jumped out of the pack, with the added benefit of 'tidy' being slang for good or nice in my birthplace of Wales.
